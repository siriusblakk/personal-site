# Intro

Hi! I am a Test Engineer and Social Investment Lead at Energy Recovery. I accelerate data to decision pipelines through technology, experiment design, test controls, data analysis, and cross-functional communication. I also lead a ~6 person taskforce to execute a $100,000 budget for company sponsored volunteer events and corporate donations.

Outside of work, I am often found hiking across the Oakland hills or devouring bowls of ramen. Seriously. I never had ramen before working in California and it has changed my life.

# I like

- Endurance sports (running, hiking, swimming, biking, nordic skiing, backpacking)
- Public Transportation
- Fishing
- Ramen
- Symphony Orchestras
- Sketching
- Dark Chocolate
- Reading Fantasy Novels
